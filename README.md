### [🌤️ AWS (Amazon Web Services) Weather Dashboard ☔️ (30 Days Dev Ops Challenge)](https://github.com/fpier042/aws-weather-app.git)
The following code is for an interactive Python application allowing users to fetch and display current (real-time and location-based) weather data for multiple cities. It utilizes the OpenWeather API (application programming interface) to retrieve factual weather information, stores this data in an AWS S3 bucket, and also generates an HTML file of this data. It: 
- Retrieves real-time weather data for multiple cities
- Displays temperature (°F), humidity, and various weather conditions
- Automatically stores the weather data in the user's AWS S3 bucket
- Supports weather tracking across multiple cities
- Provides a timestamp for all data, to assist the user with keeping track of their data history

### [🏀 NBA Game Day Notifications/ Live Sports Alerts ⛹🏾‍♂️ (30 Days Dev Ops Challenge)](https://github.com/fpier042/nba-game-day-notifications.git)
Here is documentation detailing how to develop a system which retrieves real-time NBA game scores and automatically sends such updates to subscribers through SMS or email. Perfect for hard-core sports fans! It runs on AWS (Amazon Web Services) using cloud-based architecture, making it cost-effective and scalable; and it utilizes an external API (application programming interface) and AWS Lambda, EventBridge, and SNS. It provides: 
- Real-time NBA game scores, using an external API
- Formatted score updates sent to subscribers via SMS and email notifications, using Amazon SNS
- Scheduled automation for regular updates via Amazon EventBridge
- Secure AWS IAM role configuration
